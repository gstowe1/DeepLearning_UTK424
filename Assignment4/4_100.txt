wants to know him 
 they can see that hes just a fool 
 and he never gives an answer 
 but the fool on the hill 
 sees the sun going down 
 and the eyes in his head 
 see the world spinning around 
 well on his way his head in a cloud 
 the man of a thousand voices talking percetly loud 
 but nobody ever hears him 
 or the sound he appears to make 
 and he never seems to notice 
 but the fool on the hill 
 nobody seems to like him 
 they can tell what he wants to do 
 and he never shows his feelings 
 but the fool on the hill 
 the inner light 
 without going out of my door 
 i can know all things of earth 
 with out looking out of my window
